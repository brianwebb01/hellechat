[ MUST HAVE ]
--------------
- Customize the SAIL docker configuration to have 2 app servers that nginx
proxies to so a request running in PHP can make a request to itself (the app).
With just artisan serve this fails bc the app is locked trying to call itself
till the request times out.
   - Not sure if this will work b/c sail combines the app and the nginx container

- Wire up service accounts ui
- Wire up numbers ui
- Wire up messages ui
- Wire up voicemail ui
- Wire up contacts ui



[ SHOULD HAVE ]
---------------
- post account creation dashboard directions (goes away after some event)
- user gotify endpoint setting on user w/ new message, new voicemail requests
- Contact Import


[ COULD HAVE ]
--------------
- Number could have custom voicemail text or recording
- Observers / queued jobs to delete records from provider after ingestion. (means we have to store files locally)


[ WOULD LIKE TO HAVE]
---------------------
- Encrypted database w/ User Key SO... access to DB still can't see everything.
- Purchase numbers & auto-config sip, number and message endpoints.  All user would do would be enter service-account info.
- Self hosted docker-compose setup with: web, app, db, queue-worker, queue-server, gotify
- Inbound / Outbound message handling with Telnyx
- Voicemail call control for Telnyx
- Voicemail recording handling with Telnyx
